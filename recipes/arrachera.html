    <h1>Arrachera (Mexican Skirt Steak for Tacos)</h1>

    <img src="../img/arrachera.webp" alt="Arrachera image">

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a traditional arrachera recipe, which is a thinly sliced skirt steak with seasonings. The longer it
        marinates, the more robust the flavor will be. Heat tortillas on the grill or in the microwave. Serve the
        arrachera with warmed tortillas and your favorite taco toppings, such as onion, cilantro, hot sauce, lettuce,
        cheese, and more.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place a single layer of steak in a shallow casserole dish. Sprinkle a portion of lime juice, sazón, and
            adobo seasoning. Top with chopped onion pieces. Repeat layers until all pieces of steak are seasoned. Pour
